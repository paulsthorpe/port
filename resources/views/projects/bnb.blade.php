            <p class="center-text">
                The company has been successful without much marketing intervention. Their business resides along I-95 and simple billboards have driven in enough business to more than keep this shop thriving. Business owner Randy Pritchard has owned several domain names for the business since before opening day but has yet to get a website associated with it. I was thrilled when approached about creating a website for the company. I knew the restaurant and highly respected their product.
                <br></br>
                Initial goals were to create another marketing resource that was solely owned by the company. I understood this concept, but couldn't help but throw out extra ideas for the project. Before long we had an extensive project laid out, complete with an online ordering system, employee timeclock and sales reporting.<br></br>
                I decided a single page website would work as the main website. There was not a lor of content that needed to be included. A good looking website with information such as the menu, hours and a google map were the main requirements, nothing that would require a multi-page website.<br>Next was dealing with the administration area. Lots of forms and tables mad this a good place to use bootstrap for a clean interface that didn't require a lot of custom styling.<br>
                The online ordering system was another consideration, I wanted something that was easy to use and was fast. I didn't want a lof of page refreshes so going with PHP templates was not going to cut it. I considered React or Angular to build this application on. In the end Angular won out.. The timeclock application and most everything on the administration side could deal with page refreshes and such, so this was left to PHP templates.

            <p class="text-right">This was supposed to be a simple marketing tool. The only real requirements were menu, hours and location information. The information is mainly to serve travellers who come across a billboard on the highway and want to know more before stopping and then trying to locate the business. This single page layout houses all of this information and makes finding things like the business phone number, hours and menu information easy. A google map was integrated to reduce confusion in finding the restaurant. </p>

            <p class="wide-center-text">
              The next step was starting on the ordering application. I had considered one of several Javascript frameworks to build this part of the application on. My main considerations were the React library and Angular. When I started this project, Angular2 was a week out from reaching release candidate. I had also seen that Angular2 was built on typescript, something I was interested in learning more about. Angular2 is also a framework with many of the tools needed to create a project already included. Anytime I have a project that allows me creative freedom, I try to experiment and create something new and fresh. I like React, but I felt Angular2 had the advantage of keeping me from so many choices in selecting packages. This would in the end make this project a little smoother and decrease development time.

        <div class="phase">
          <div class="width-container">
            <p class="text-left-wide">I also knew that having an ordering application decoupled from the server would require the implementation of an API, which I had chosen to write with Laravel. Not much help was available on this combination of technologies yet, seeing as how Angular2 still hasn't made it to Release yet, and that Angular2 and Laravel projects are scarce for the time being. I chose to tackle the project anyway and I am glad I did. The application is FAST! The ordering application takes a second to load but after this initial loading the application is smoking fast and seamless. That was the intention all along so I get all giddy inside when I get to see it in action, just the way I imagined it when planning. <br></br>  The application has a great layout for any device, The mobile site and the Desktop versions look similar with only small layout changes, but both a beautiful instances of clean UI in my opinion(in my opinion, one of my weaker talents). <br></br> When this part of the project had neared completion, the idea of a reordering feature was suggested. I agreed this would be a great feature and spent some time working out the details. In the end, customers can pull up previous orders by their phone number and then reorder past orders. A great idea that I had not thought of, and Im glad it worked out because I see this as a valuable feature. <br></br>
            All of the features are reliant on an API written In Laravel to retrieve menu items, toppings and past orders. The API also receives orders as they are made and stores them in the database while also alerting the restaurant of current orders. <br></br>Employees are given notification to new orders, and are also given access to the orders details. Once an order is completed in the kitchen the order should be marked on the interface provided to store employees, this interface also keep track of how long orders are taking to be completed. This information is available on the employee interface but also to the store owner who can keep track of his kitchen's performance using this as a gauge. Past orders are always available for reference and sortable. Keeping track of online sales are built into this project, separate and inclusive to overall sales.</p>

            <p class="wide-center-text">This project was exceptionally reliant on server side code. There are several smaller applications built into this package, that could be exported and used singularly, all of which rely on a server and database. The order application relies on an API written to communicate with data on the server. Admittedly, I had to start working on the API before the ordering application was finished so I could test all of the functionality. I also wanted the menu in the ordering application to be dynamic instead of being hardcoded. This allows the ordering application to be easily manipulated. Simply put, if the owners of the website want to add new menu items or toppings, the menus will automatically reflect those changes. This eliminates future maintenance cost in this area. <br></br> The timeclock and sales reporting are also driven by the database. Reports are generated completely on the server, and the server is responsible for delegating emails. </p>

              The Result from all of the above is a functional website that serves the original intended purpose of the business, plus some. They have acquired their extra means of marketing and added an extra layer of convenience for customers. The online ordering system is an added feature that exceeded expectations and delivers a modern solution to ordering food. Most people expect these types of things from larger companies and giving this opportunity to a small business is a great pleasure of mine. They certainly care about their product, and as a fellow do-it-righter I am glad to give them an extra tool to succeed.
              <br></br> The business solutions should ease some of their daily functions and free up valuable time for all those involved in making this business awesome.<br></br> This project is not live yet, but for now there is a live demo available until coordination on several parties can come together to get the information together and workable. Feel free to poke around, place orders and do whatever, it is merely a testing ground for now. Also make sure to hit /store_login as well. It looks password protected but isn't for obvious reasons. Once launched, good luck with that :) <a href="http://www.paul-webdev.com">LIVE DEMO HERE</a>
